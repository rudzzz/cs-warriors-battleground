<p align="justify">
    Warrior's Battleground is a simple text-based battle game where two warriors face off against each other in intense duels.

## How to Play
<p align="justify">

    1. Create Your Warriors: The game includes two types of warriors: the regular Warrior and the MagicWarrior. You can create instances of these warriors by instantiating the Warrior and MagicWarrior classes, respectively, and setting their initial attributes, such as name, health, attack maximum, and block maximum.

    2. Start the Battle: Once you have created your warriors, you can start the battle by calling the Battle.StartFight() method and passing in the two warriors as arguments. The battle will continue until one of the warriors' health reaches zero or below, indicating a defeat..

    3. Monitor the Battle: The game will display the progress of the battle, including the attacks and damage dealt by each warrior, as well as their remaining health. The game will also announce the winner once the battle is over..

    4. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the warriors' names and initial 
    health, attack maximum, and block maximum values.

    5. The game will simulate the battle between the two warriors, with each warrior 
    taking turns to attack and block.

    6. The game will continue until one warrior's health reaches zero, at which point the game will end, and the winner will be displayed.
